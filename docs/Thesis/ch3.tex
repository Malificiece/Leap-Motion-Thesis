\chapter{Methodology --- describes/justifies data gathering methods, how data is analyzed}

Pilot 1 -- Changes for study:
- Simplified keyboard used (removed enter, removed space, changed location of backspace)
- keyboard mod - disallow backspace of correct letters
- keyboard mod - Removed having to press a key for confirmation of word (now confirmation on "release")

Pilot 2 -- Changes for study:
- Change to intermittent exit surveys
- UP IN THE AIR - remove stylus for mid air keyboards and use finger instead
- UP IN THE AIR - change controller to WGK??
- UP IN THE AIR - don't force person to be correct??

 This chapter describes and justifies the data gathering method used. This chapter also outlines how you
analyzed your data.

 Begin by describing the method you chose and why this method was the most appropriate. In doing so, you
should cite reference literature about the method.

 Next, detail every step of the data gathering and analysis process. Although this section varies depending
on method and analysis technique chosen, many of the following areas typically are addressed:

--description of research design
 internal validity
 external validity

--description of population and description of and justification for type of sample used or method for
selecting units of observation

--development of instrument or method for making observations (e.g., question guide, categories for content
analysis)
 pre-test
 reliability and validity of instrument or method

--administration of instrument or method for making observations (e.g., interviews, observation, content
analysis)

--coding of data

--description of data analysis
 statistical analysis and tests performed
 identification of themes/categories (qualitative or historical research) 

\section{Word Dictionary choices}

\subsection{why we want similar words}

\subsection {algorithm used vs frechet distance}

\section{Word-Gesture Keyboard Construction}

\subsection{Leap Motion --- Needs to be referenced in intro}

\subsection{Writing the Code --- rename}

\subsection{Designing various WGKs}

\subsubsection{Separating words --- rename (figure out ordering)}

\subsubsection{Separation of motor space and display space --- rename (figure out ordering)}

\subsubsection{Size of motor space / User calibrated --- rename (figure out ordering)}

\subsection{Word-Gesture Recognition}

Lack of recognition and reason for it. Simulated recognition.

\section{WGKs}

\subsection{Controller WGK --- Need to see if we want to change the implementation to a Controller WGK from std controller}
