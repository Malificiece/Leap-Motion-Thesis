\chapter{Design --- how I built it, what it does, the keyboards used, etc}

\section{Word Dictionary}

\subsection{Why Similar Words are Important}

\subsection {Word Dissimilarity Algorithm}

\section{Word-Gesture Keyboard Construction}

\subsection{Leap Motion --- Needs to be referenced in intro}

\subsection{Writing the Code --- rename}

\subsection{Designing various WGKs}

\subsubsection{Separating words --- rename (figure out ordering)}

\subsubsection{Separation of motor space and display space --- rename (figure out ordering)}

\subsubsection{Size of motor space / User calibrated --- rename (figure out ordering)}

\subsection{Word-Gesture Recognition}

Lack of recognition and reason for it. Simulated recognition.

\section{WGKs}

\subsection{Controller WGK --- Need to see if we want to change the implementation to a Controller WGK from std controller}

\subsection{Surface WGK}

\subsubsection{Touch screen}

\subsubsection{leap surface emulation}

\subsection{Mid-Air WGKs}

\subsubsection{static}

\subsubsection{dynamic}

\subsubsection{bimodal}

\subsubsection{pinch gesture emulation}

\section{Calibration}
--- gorilla arm syndrom. Has a similar calibration as alvins Personal Space but this calibration was optional. This calibration space is also more complicated due to the nature of having to precisely interact with the generated plane.

THIS SECTION WILL GO THROUGH THE REASONS FOR CALIBRATION AND ALIVINS THING
