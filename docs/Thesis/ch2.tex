\chapter{Literature Review --- related works, describe and analyize previous works, what is known/not known, leads to hypotheses}

The purpose of the study should suggest some theoretical framework to be explained further in this chapter.
The literature review thus describes and analyzes previous research on the topic.

 This chapter, however, should not merely string together what other researchers have found. Rather, you
should discuss and analyze the body of knowledge with the ultimate goal of determining what is known and is not
known about the topic. This determination leads to your research questions and/or hypotheses. In some cases, of
course, you may determine that replicating previous research is needed.
