\chapter{Discussion, Future Work and Conclusion}

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Calibration}

\subsection{Reasons stylus was used instead of hands}

\subsection{Reasons that I didn't implement a word-prediction algorithm for word-gesture keyboard}

\subsection{issues with entrance/exit of touch plane}
Solve the problem of entering/leaving the touch plane (we move along a sphere) so when
	moving away from the touch plane, you often hit the key above what you're leaving on.

\section{Future Work}

\subsection{image processing, any keyboard}

\subsection{augmented reality adaption}

\subsection{using sphere techniques to better determine the leaps position on a surface}

\subsection{with better leap detection, use hand instead of stylus}

\subsection{would word-gesture controller-based keyboard be better for consoles}

\subsubsection{Use WKG with controller}

\subsubsection{Use gesture controller for text entry}

\subsection{Accessibility}
