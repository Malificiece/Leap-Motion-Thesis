\chapter{Introduction --- purpose for study, significance of study, original contribution}

In the first chapter, clearly state what the purpose of the study is and explain the study's significance. The
significance is addressed by discussing how the study adds to the theoretical body of knowledge in the field and the
study's practical significance for communication professionals in the field being examined.

Ph.D. students also must explain how their research makes an original contribution to the body of
knowledge in their discipline. They also should address the significance of the study for mass communication
education.

It is especially critical that this chapter be well developed. Without a clearly defined purpose and strong
theoretical grounding, the thesis or dissertation is fundamentally flawed from the outset.
