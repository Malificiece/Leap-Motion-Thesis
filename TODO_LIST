TODO:
1) Refine leap swipe for known words. - Needs angle/arc/src/dest key vector etc to determine correctness of path.
2) Consider stabilizing the leap point based on delta velocity and delta position.
3) Finish implementing data recording and readback for tutorial/demonstration.
4) Finish Exit Survey UI / Save data to relevant data path.
5) Get preliminary data.
6) Add another UI/button to the control center. We want a data viewer that
   will allow me to select anything that has been previously recorded and
   view the playback.
