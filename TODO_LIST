TODO:
0) Resave tutorial files and add tutorial INFO!
1) Modify the pinch threshold to further stabilize it and try to account for an actual pinch.
	Consider using the fingers and measuring the distances to also determine a pinch gesture.
	Lastly let's consider changing the angle of the leap to have a better view of the fingers.
2) Implement a hand alternative for both the surface and air keyboards on the leap.
3) Solve the problem of entering/leaving the touch plane (we move along a sphere) so when
	moving away from the touch plane, you often hit the key above what you're leaving on.
	This can probably be solved by aligning the touch plane normal to the direction that the
	tool is pointing.
4) Consider a moving touch plane that aligns to the normal of the tool as well as the movements of the tool.
	This will be similar to the leap's already implemented moving touch plane. This will also allow us to
	test it as an alternative. This could be compared to the AR static keyboard.
5) Allow the user to move an already pre-calibrated plane using the tool as the center/normal.
6) Implement the data parser to convert from playback format to Matlab format.
7) Implement AR to help with feed back for air based keyboards
8) Consider further stabilizing the leap point based on delta velocity and delta position.
9) Add another UI/button to the control center. We want a data viewer that
   will allow me to select anything that has been previously recorded and
   view the playback.
