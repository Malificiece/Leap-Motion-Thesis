TODO:
1) FILL OUT IRB INFORMATION AND SUBMIT IT SOON!!!! YOU NEED TO DO THIS BEFORE THE NEXT DEADLINE. FINISH THIS BEFORE MARCH 6th
2) There is an issue when calibrating a plane at too much of an angle that the z axis becomes flipped. Try to solve this issue.
3) Add unique tutorial INFO!
4) Implement a hand alternative for both the surface and air keyboards on the leap.
5) Implement the data parser to convert from playback format to Matlab format.
6) Implement AR to help with feed back for air based keyboards
7) Solve the problem of entering/leaving the touch plane (we move along a sphere) so when
	moving away from the touch plane, you often hit the key above what you're leaving on.
	This can probably be solved by aligning the touch plane normal to the direction that the
	tool is pointing.
8) Add another UI/button to the control center. We want a data viewer that
   will allow me to select anything that has been previously recorded and
   view the playback.
